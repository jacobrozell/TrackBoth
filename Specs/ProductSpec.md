# TrackBoth Product Spec

> Spec governance: behavior changes update the matching spec in the same commit.


This spec is the product contract for the recovery overhaul. It was copied from the approved plan (2026-10-28).

## 2. Product thesis and psychology

### 2.1 One-sentence product

> **TrackBoth helps you quit what's hurting you and build what helps: a 10-second daily check-in, a tool for riding out urges, and progress a slip can't erase.**

Positioning: *"Quit vices. Build habits."* The "Both" in the name now means **quit one thing and build its replacement**. That's grounded in habit-reversal research: a behavior you remove leaves a gap, and a competing behavior should fill it.

### 2.2 The psychology the design is built on

Every feature below traces back to one of these. If a feature can't be traced, it gets cut.

| Principle | Source (for the specs) | What it means for TrackBoth |
|-----------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Abstinence violation effect (AVE)** | Marlatt & Gordon, *Relapse Prevention* (1985) | After a lapse, people who blame themselves and feel all-or-nothing are much more likely to fully relapse. **So:** a slip restarts the current run but never erases total free days, savings, or "27 of the last 30 days". Slip copy is compassionate and frames the slip as information. |
| **Urge surfing** | Bowen, Chawla & Marlatt, *Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention* (2010) | Urges rise, peak and pass like a wave. Watching them instead of obeying them weakens them. **So:** the core in-the-moment feature is a guided "ride it out" screen with breathing, a timer, your reasons, and your plan. |
| **Implementation intentions** | Gollwitzer (1999) | "If X happens, then I will Y" plans roughly double follow-through. **So:** every vice has one optional "When I feel the urge, I will…" plan, shown during urges and edited after slips. |
| **Motivational interviewing / personal values** | Miller & Rollnick | Reasons you put in your own words beat generic motivation. **So:** onboarding asks *why* and saves the answer as the first Reason. Reasons come up during urges and after slips. |
| **Trigger awareness (HALT and friends)** | Recovery practice (Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired) | Seeing your own patterns builds self-efficacy. **So:** slips and urges get optional one-tap trigger tags. Progress shows your top triggers and your hardest time of day. |
| **Fogg Behavior Model: B = MAP** | BJ Fogg, *Tiny Habits* | Behavior needs Motivation + Ability + a Prompt. **So:** a daily prompt (one notification), maximum ability (the check-in takes about 10 seconds), and an immediate celebration (haptic + animation). |
| **Missing one day doesn't break a habit** | Lally et al. (2010), *How are habits formed* | One missed day didn't measurably hurt habit formation. **So:** habit streaks follow "never miss twice": one missed day pauses the streak, two in a row end it. |
| **Self-compassion predicts recovery better than self-criticism** | Neff; addiction research on shame | **So:** no red, no ✕, no "failed". Slips use amber and calm wording. |
| **Language matters** | NIDA, *Words Matter* | "Clean/dirty" stigmatizes. **So:** use "free" ("12 days free"), "slip" (not "relapse" or "fail"), and "use" (not "abuse"). |

### 2.3 The core loop

```
          ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
          │                                                            │
   PROMPT │  Daily reminder at your chosen time (one per day, max)     │
          │  + an urge (internal) → home-screen quick action "Urge"    │
          ▼                                                            │

          │  (≤10 seconds)   ─or─   Urge flow: ride it out (2–10 min)   │
          ▼                                                            │
   REWARD │  Immediate: haptic + "13 days free · $104 saved"            │
          │  Milestones: 1, 3, 7, 14, 30… days (re-earnable after slip) │
          │  Urges beaten counter: "That's 6 urges you've ridden out"  │
          ▼                                                            │
   INVEST │  Reasons, your if-then plan, trigger tags, helper habits →  │
          │  makes the next urge flow more personal and more effective │
          └──────────────────────────────── (next day) ─────────────────┘
```

**Ethical guardrail:** success means the user needs the app *less* over time. We don't optimize for time-in-app. No variable-reward slot mechanics, no streak freezes you pay for, no guilt notifications, at most one reminder a day plus milestone notices, no leaderboards, no social comparison.

### 2.4 What we are deliberately NOT building

| Cut | Why |
|-----|-----|
| Goals (weekly/monthly/yearly targets, quantity goals, Goals tab) | A monthly vice target ("8 times this month") contradicts quitting. Milestones are the goal. |
| Quantity, units, mood chips, starred entries | Extra input on every log adds friction and doesn't change behavior. Trigger tags replace mood where it matters (slips and urges). |
| Charts tab (line, bar, heatmap), chart PNG/PDF export | Generic analytics. Replaced by a calendar plus three recovery stats. |
| Multiple color themes, font picker | Decoration. One calm palette that follows system light/dark. |
| Per-device layout files (4 per screen) | 4× the QA work. **1.0 ships iPhone portrait.** iPad and landscape come back in Phase 15 as **one adaptive layout per screen**, not separate files (D6, §8.7). |
| Widget, Watch, Live Activities, Shortcuts | Post-launch. A single "days free" widget is Phase 14 (optional). |
| Launch splash animation | Delays the moment of need. The system launch screen is enough. |
| Week-start picker | Use `Calendar.current.firstWeekday` (follows the user's locale). |
| Placeholder "My habit / My vice" rows | Fake data. Onboarding requires one real choice. |
| Demo data in Release | Debug and screenshots only. |

## 3. Decision gates (defaults chosen — owner may override)

The agent proceeds with the **Default** unless the owner has written something different in the Owner column. **Owner answers recorded 2026-10-28.** Gates with an empty Owner cell use their default.

| # | Decision | Default | Owner |
|---|----------|---------|-------|
| D1 | Data reset. The app has never shipped, so the schema is redefined from scratch with a **new store file**. Old exports stay importable. | **Yes** | ✅ Yes, start fresh (app not released) |
| D2 | Keep habits? | **Yes**, framed as "Building" (helper habits that replace the vice). A user can still track habits only. | |
| D3 | How vice days count | **Presumed free:** time counts up from the quit date, and only *logged slips* break it. Check-ins *confirm* days (solid in the calendar); unconfirmed past days count but look hollow. Same model as I Am Sober. | ✅ Yes, same as I Am Sober |
| D4 | Habit streak rule | **Never miss twice** (§6.6) | |
| D5 | Vocabulary | **"Free / slip"** (not "clean / relapse / fail") | ✅ Yes |
| D6 | Devices | **1.0: iPhone, portrait only.** Every screen is built **adaptive-ready** (§8.7) so iPad and portrait + landscape on both devices can be added later without a redesign. | ✅ iPhone + iPad, portrait + landscape, in a future release → Phase 15 |
| D7 | Widget | **Post-launch** (Phase 14, optional) | |
| D8 | App lock (Face ID/passcode) | **Ship it, off by default, offered during onboarding** | |
| D9 | App Store name/subtitle | Name **TrackBoth**. Subtitle **"Quit vices. Build habits."** (25/30 chars) | ✅ Yes |
| D10 | Version | **Stays 1.0.0** (never shipped). Build number continues from **6**. | |
| D11 | Monetization | **Free**, no IAP (existing decision) | |
| D12 | Telemetry | **None** | |
| D13 | Live clock granularity | **Minutes** (`12d 4h 13m`). Calmer than a seconds ticker. | |

## 4. Target product

### 4.1 Information architecture

Three tabs. That's it.

| Tab | SF Symbol | Purpose |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| **Today** | `sun.max` | Check-in, vice cards with live free-time, helper habit checklist, the **"I'm having an urge"** button. |
| **Progress** | `chart.line.uptrend.xyaxis` | One card per metric with its key numbers → tap for Metric Detail (calendar, reasons, plan, triggers, history editing). |
| **Settings** | `gearshape` | Reminders, app lock, appearance, backup/restore, delete, get help now, about. |

Presented flows (sheets or full-screen covers): **Check-in**, **Urge**, **Slip**, **Celebration**, **Add/Edit metric**, **Day editor**, **Onboarding**, **Lock screen**.

Entry points into the **Urge** flow: the Today button, the home-screen quick action (long-press the app icon), the `trackboth://urge` URL, and the "Having an urge?" link in the Check-in sheet.

### 4.2 Today screen

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐

└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Rules:
- Order: CheckInBanner (if pending) → "Quitting" (vices, by `sortOrder`) → "Building" (habits) → SOSButton pinned with `safeAreaInset(edge: .bottom)`.
- The SOSButton shows only if there's at least one active vice.
- Tapping a ViceCard opens Metric Detail (pushes onto the Progress tab's stack: switch tab, then push. Or present Metric Detail as a sheet from Today, which is simpler; **use the sheet**).
- Tapping a habit's circle toggles done for today (haptic `.success` on done, `.selection` on undo). Tapping the row text opens Metric Detail.
- Empty state (no metrics; only reachable after deleting everything): "Start with one thing" + button → Add metric.
- If yesterday is unconfirmed for any vice **and** the user opened the app before noon, show one dismissible row above the banner: "Yesterday: were you free from Alcohol?" with [Yes] [I slipped]. (Keeps the calendar honest without nagging.)

### 4.3 Daily check-in (the core ritual)

Sheet, `.presentationDetents([.medium, .large])`.

```
Daily check-in · Tue, Oct 28

Alcohol
 [  Free today  ]   [ I slipped ]

Social media
 [  Free today  ]   [ I slipped ]

Building
 ○ Go for a walk
 ○ Call a friend

Having an urge right now? →            (opens Urge flow)

[ Done ]                                 (enabled once every vice has an answer)
```

- "Free today" → `RecoveryStore.markFree(metric, on: today)`.
- "I slipped" → present the **Slip flow** with `day = today`. When it finishes, that row shows "Slip logged · thanks for being honest" and can't be toggled back from here (fix it in the Day editor).
- Habit rows toggle done.
- **Done** → `CheckInCompleteView` (inside the same sheet): an animated check, then one line per vice ("13 days free · $104 saved"), then any milestone → Celebration.
- Check-in counts as **complete** for a day when every active vice has an entry for that day. Habits are optional for completeness.

### 4.4 Urge flow ("I'm having an urge")

`fullScreenCover`, calm background. Four steps:

1. **Which one?** Skipped when there's only one active vice. A list of active vices.
2. **How strong?** Five big buttons (1 Mild … 5 Intense), default 3, with a "Skip" option. Creates an `UrgeEvent(outcome: .inProgress)`.
3. **Ride it out**
   - A `BreathingCircle`: grows for 4s ("Breathe in"), shrinks for 6s ("Breathe out"), loops. Under Reduce Motion it shows only the text cue, switching every 4s/6s.
   - Countdown starting at **5:00**, with a "+5 min" button. Copy above it: *"Urges rise, peak, and pass, like a wave. Let's ride this one out."*
   - **Your why** card: rotates through the vice's Reasons every 8s (or shows them as a list under Reduce Motion).
   - **Your plan** card, if `ifThenPlan` is set: "When I feel the urge, I will: …"
   - **Try one instead:** chips for active habits. Tapping one marks it done today (checkmark plus haptic).
   - Buttons: **[The urge passed]** (primary) and **[I slipped]** (secondary, plain text style). The X in the corner asks "How did it go?" → passed / slipped / not sure.
   - When the timer hits 0: a soft haptic and "Still with it? You can add 5 minutes, or check in with yourself."
4. **Outcome**
   - *Passed* → `outcome = .resisted` → screen: "You rode it out." + "That's **N** urges you've beaten." + optional "What set it off?" trigger chips → **Done**.
   - *Slipped* → `outcome = .slipped` → Slip flow, prefilled with the triggers picked here. The urge's triggers are copied onto the slip entry.
   - *Not sure* → `outcome = .unknown`, back to Today.

### 4.5 Slip flow

Sheet, one scrolling form, **no red anywhere**.

```
Thanks for being honest.
A slip is information, not failure. Let's learn from it.

When?   [Just now] [Earlier today] [Yesterday] [Pick a day…]
What was going on?  (chips, multi-select — TriggerTag list §6.7)
Anything else? (optional note)
Next time I feel the urge, I will…  (prefilled with current plan)

[ Save ]
```

`occurredAt` rules: *Just now* and *Earlier today* = `now`. *Yesterday* = start of today − 1 second (23:59:59 yesterday). *Pick a day* = that day at 23:59:59, or `now` if it's today. The date picker range is from `startOfDay(metric.startedAt)` to today.

On save: `RecoveryStore.logSlip(...)`, and if the plan text changed, update `metric.ifThenPlan`. Then show **SlipSummaryView**:

> **Your free clock restarts from here.**
> You still have **27 of your last 30 days** free and **$135** saved. That progress is real and it stays.
> *[Reason card: first Reason]*
> Need more support? → Get help now (Crisis resources, §4.9)
> **[Back to Today]**

Haptic: `.impact(weight: .light)`. Never `.error`.

### 4.6 Language rules (applies to all copy)

| Use | Don't use |
|-----|-----------|
| free, free from, days free | clean, sober (unless the user typed it), dirty |
| slip, slipped | relapse, fail, failed, broke, ruined, lost |
| urge | craving is OK; temptation is moralizing |
| "Thanks for being honest" | "Oops", "Too bad", "Try harder" |
| "Your clock restarts" | "Your streak was reset to 0" |
| "Don't miss twice" (habits) | "You'll lose your streak!" |
| Second person, short sentences, plain words | Clinical jargon, exclamation-mark spam (max one per screen) |

Notification copy is never guilt-based. In **discreet mode** it never names the vice.

### 4.7 Progress tab

- Top: a summary row of three `StatTile`s: **Total saved** (sum across vices, hidden if no costs set), **Urges beaten** (all time), **Days checked in** (last 30).
- Then one `ProgressMetricCard` per active metric (vices first). For a vice: "12 days free · longest 40 · 27/30 days". For a habit: "5-day run · best 14 · 22/30 days". A chevron leads to **Metric Detail**.
- An "Archived" disclosure at the bottom lists archived metrics (they can be restored).

**Metric Detail** (`MetricDetailScreen`), top to bottom:
1. Header: icon, name, live free clock (vice) or run count (habit).
2. `StatTile` grid (2×2). Vice: Current run, Longest run, Free days (last 30), Saved. Habit: Current run, Best run, Done (last 30), Done (all time).
3. **Calendar:** month grid with month paging back to `startedAt`. Day cell states: confirmed free (solid brand), presumed free (outlined brand), slip (amber dot), habit done (solid indigo), before start or future (dimmed). Tap a past day → **Day editor** sheet: vice = [Free] [Slipped] [Clear]; habit = [Done] [Not done]. Changing to "Slipped" opens the Slip flow for that day.
4. **Your reasons:** a list with add, edit, swipe-to-delete, and drag to reorder. The first one is the "primary" reason.
5. **Your plan:** the if-then text with an Edit button.
6. **Patterns** (vices only, shown once there are ≥3 slips + urges combined): top 3 triggers as horizontal bars with counts; "Hardest time: Evenings" (§6.8).
7. **Urges:** "Beaten 9 of 11" (resisted / total, excluding in-progress).
8. Toolbar → **Edit** (MetricForm: name, icon, start date, cost per day, archive, delete).

### 4.8 Onboarding (8 short steps, all skippable except step 2)

| Step | Screen | Saves |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | **Welcome.** "Quit what's hurting you. Build what helps." Three lines on how it works. [Get started] | — |
| 2 | **What do you want to quit?** Preset grid (§13.2) plus "Something else…" (text field). Multi-select, max 3. A "I only want to build habits" link skips to step 5. **Need ≥1 vice or the habit-only link.** | draft vices |
| 3 | For each chosen vice (one page each): **When did you last [use/do] it?** [Today] [Yesterday] [Pick a date] → `startedAt` (Today = now; Yesterday/Pick = that day at 23:59:59, as with slips). **What does it cost you per day?** Optional currency field. | `startedAt`, `costPerDay` |
| 4 | **Why do you want to quit [first vice]?** Multiline text with prompt chips that insert a starter ("For my health…", "For my family…", "To save money…", "To feel in control…"). Skippable. | first `Reason` |
| 5 | **What helps you?** Helper habit presets (§13.3) + custom, multi-select, max 3. Skippable. | draft habits |
| 6 | **Daily check-in time.** Time picker, default 8:00 PM. Copy: "We'll send one gentle reminder a day. Nothing else." [Turn on reminders] → *then* call the system permission prompt. [Not now]. | reminder prefs |
| 7 | **Keep it private?** "Lock TrackBoth with Face ID." [Turn on] [Not now]. Hidden if the device has no passcode set. | lock pref |
| 8 | **Important.** "TrackBoth is a self-help tool, not medical treatment. Stopping some substances suddenly, like alcohol, benzodiazepines, or opioids, can be dangerous. Talk to a doctor. If you're in crisis, help is in Settings → Get help now." [I understand] | `hasAcceptedDisclaimer` |

Finish → create everything in one `RecoveryStore` transaction → land on Today with the CheckInBanner showing.

### 13.1 Glossary
- **Vice / Quitting:** something the user wants to stop. Shows "days free".
- **Habit / Building:** a helper behavior the user wants to do daily. Shows "N-day run".
- **Run:** the current unbroken stretch (vices: since the last slip; habits: never-miss-twice).
- **Presumed free:** a past day with no entry after the quit date. It counts as free but shows hollow.
- **Check-in:** confirming today for every active vice (habits optional).
