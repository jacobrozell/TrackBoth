# Device QA matrix — adaptive layout

Manual checklist for landscape, iPad multitasking, and iPhone Duo. Mark rows with date, device, and pass/fail after automated UI tests and spot checks.

Related: [Specs/DesignSystemSpec.md](../Specs/DesignSystemSpec.md) §8.7, [ongoing/adaptive-layout-plan.md](../ongoing/adaptive-layout-plan.md).

**Automated (2026-10-31):** `TrackBothTests` (incl. `AdaptiveLayoutTests`), `TrackBothUITests` + `AdaptiveLayoutUITests` on iPhone 17; iPad-width `testProgressSplitOnRegularWidth` when window ≥ 744pt.
